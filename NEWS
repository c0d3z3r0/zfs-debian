zfs-linux (0.6.0.7-0ubuntu2) unstable; urgency=medium

  NOTE:  The removal of the zfs or zfs-lib package by this
         upgrade, either now or later, is expected and safe.

  Please ensure that the ubuntu-zfs package is installed so
  that the upgrade happens automatically.

  This is happening so that the ZFS packages for Linux are
  more like the packages already in Debian kFreeBSD.
