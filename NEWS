zfs-linux (0.6.0.92-0ubuntu1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Feature flags are enabled by default.

  This means that ZoL will now create pools in a way that is
  incompatible with Solaris. If you need Solaris compatibility,
  then create pools like this:

    # zpool create -o version=28 tank ...

  ZoL remains compatible with all other ZFS implementations derived
  from Illumos.
