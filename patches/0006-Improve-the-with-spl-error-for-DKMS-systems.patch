Subject: [PATCH 6/7] Improve the --with-spl error for DKMS systems.

If the SPL module is unavailable, then the operator gets an error
message that does not apply to installations that are mananged by
DKMS. Change the error message to fit apt-get systems.

A better solution would be to implement a dependency model in DKMS,
or to bundle SPL into the ZFS package.
